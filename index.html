    <h1>THE PATH OF LEARNING TO CODE</h1>

        <h3>Journey:<br> A long and often difficult process of personal change and development.</h3>

        <p>To me, coding is a bridge between logic and art.  I've never been one to be very creative on an artisic level, but I can neat freak and orgainze you to death.  I've decide to use my interest in Web Developmenet as a way to get the best of both worlds.  I've abandonded and continued down this path many times before and hope that this time I stay moving forward for good.  Join me for the good, bad and the ugly of me teaching myself to code!</p>

    <p class="post_text">It's crazy to me that HTML, CSS and Javascript is considered the basics.  That's three different languages just to build and style a website.  Then there is the back-end.  The languages that is going to be your logic.  It's going to be your database.  Then you have frameworks.  I'm not really sure I understand what they actually are to be honest.  There's also Git.  People who code, how do you digest all of this?  I'm sure it will just click eventually, but it's SUPER overwhelming right now.  Send me good vibes.

    <p class="post_text">No matter what I am learning I always seem to get ahead of myself.  I try to fly past the basics and get to the more advanced stuff, only to realized I still haven't really learned the basics.  First with HTML.  Then with CSS.  Once I got to Javascript I really had to take a step back and really think about what I was doing.  Video tutorials are great and open doors for a lot of opportunites, but it's important to keep in mind that you have to reinforce what you're learning from those videos.  Applying what you've learned from the video by working on a small project or exercise is really going to drill in the concept and allow you it to really stick in your mind.  I've been following Colt Steele's Bootcamp for Web Developers on Udemy (which is great and I highly recommend it) for some time now and it wasn't until a few days ago that I decided to complete start over and build small projects after a few lessons.  Since then I feel like I have a better understanding of what he's gone over and I feel less of a need to keep referring to the video as I practice more.  So yes, the old cliche is true.  Pratice really does make perfect.  If you are struggling to learn something like I've been I suggest you try testing yourself to see if that helps!
