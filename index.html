        <h3>Journey:<br> A long and often difficult process of personal change and development.</h3>

        <p>To me, coding is a bridge between logic and art.  I've never been one to be very creative on an artisic level, but I can neat freak and orgainze you to death.  I've decide to use my interest in Web Developmenet as a way to get the best of both worlds.  I've abandonded and continued down this path many times before and hope that this time I stay moving forward for good.  Join me for the good, bad and the ugly of me teaching myself to code!</p>
